# Project Title: Predicting Milling Machines Failure using Sensor Data with LR and Python

# Introduction:
Milling machines have many moving parts that can suffer from wear and tear over time, leading to failures. Additionally, improper maintenance can cause issues with machine operation and lead to costly damage. Efficient maintenance can be challenging, However, by implementing a predictive maintenance solution, we can identify and address issues to prevent costly downtime and ensure the smooth operation of those machines.

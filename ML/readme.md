### Predicting water pump failure using Sensor Data with Python
### Introduction:
- Data gathered automatically from 52 sensors along with pump status by minute starting from (2018-04-01 00:00:00) to (2018-08-31 23:59:00).
- In one year, the system failed 7 times. Those failures cause huge problems for many people and lead to huge troubles for people living and working there. The farm management can't see any pattern in the data when the system goes down, so they are not sure where to put more attention.
- We will try multiple ML models and ultimately choose the best one according to its precision and time consumed in training and fitting the model.
